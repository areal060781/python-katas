"""Exercise 12.5. Two words form a “metathesis pair” if you can transform one into the other by
swapping two letters; for example, “converse” and “conserve.” Write a program that finds all of
the metathesis pairs in the dictionary. Hint: don’t test all pairs of words, and don’t test all possible
swaps. Solution: http: // think_python. com/ code/ metathesis. py .
