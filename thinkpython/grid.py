'''Exercise 3.5. This exercise can be done using only the statements and other features we have learned
so far.
1. Write a function that draws a grid like the following:
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence:
print '+', '-'
If the sequence ends with a comma, Python leaves the line unfinished, so the value printed
next appears on the same line.
print '+',
print '-'
The output of these statements is '+ -' .
A print statement all by itself ends the current line and goes to the next line.
2. Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.
